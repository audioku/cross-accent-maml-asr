./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628489.mp3,"i finally have enough money, and all the time i need."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628490.mp3,most of them were staring quietly at the big table.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628491.mp3,"""that's not true,"" the boy said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628492.mp3,"looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628493.mp3,the wind has many names.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628494.mp3,"in any case, the desert was impassable."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628496.mp3,"""when were these books written?"" the boy asked."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628497.mp3,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628498.mp3,"the alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628499.mp3,"that first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the englishman."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628500.mp3,"the woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628501.mp3,the boy said nothing.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628503.mp3,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628504.mp3,and then he perceived it very slowly.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628505.mp3,"""it is i who dared to do so,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628506.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628507.mp3,"he had been to the village only once, the year before."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628508.mp3,but the crystal merchant had no choice.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628509.mp3,but then he stopped.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628510.mp3,"in his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628511.mp3,and they attacked an empty tent.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628513.mp3,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628514.mp3,"the englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628515.mp3,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628516.mp3,"so, he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628517.mp3,"""who are you?"" he heard a voice ask him in spanish."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628518.mp3,that's why i'm here.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628519.mp3,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628529.mp3,"""it's the emerald tablet,"" said the englishman, proud that he might teach something to the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628530.mp3,"but men began to reject simple things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628531.mp3,"""you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,"" he said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628532.mp3,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_628535.mp3,"the old man was probably a gypsy, too."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517765.mp3,"""there is no wine in this country,"" the young man said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517766.mp3,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517767.mp3,she refilled her vessel and left.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517768.mp3,"you and i aren't like hassan, that rich merchant."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517769.mp3,it was there that the wise man lived.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517770.mp3,"it was starlight, and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517771.mp3,"""we're refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,"" the other figure said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517772.mp3,the boy was surprised.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517773.mp3,"it was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517774.mp3,"in some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517775.mp3,several figures approached him.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517776.mp3,they were relieved and happy.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517777.mp3,"the world speaks many languages, the boy thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517778.mp3,gold would lose its value.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517779.mp3,"then suddenly, they kneel and die."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517780.mp3,but horses tire bit by bit.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517782.mp3,he was just and good.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517783.mp3,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this!
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517784.mp3,"if a person is living out his destiny, he knows everything he needs to know."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517785.mp3,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517786.mp3,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517787.mp3,"sometimes it's better to be with the sheep, who don't say anything."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517789.mp3,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517790.mp3,"he was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was right."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517792.mp3,"""good-bye,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517793.mp3,"and it's not love to see everything from a distance, like you do."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517794.mp3,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517795.mp3,"after all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517796.mp3,"revenge is not my style, but obviously accidents will happen."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517797.mp3,"the alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517799.mp3,"""i had never heard of alchemists before,"" the boy said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517802.mp3,this is for the boy.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517803.mp3,there was a murmur from the crowd.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517804.mp3,"""because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,"" the boy said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517805.mp3,"throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517806.mp3,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517807.mp3,"""we're in no hurry,"" the chief answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517808.mp3,"another, who was searching the boy's bags, found the piece of gold."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517810.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517811.mp3,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517812.mp3,"""men dream more about coming home than about leaving,"" the boy said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517813.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517815.mp3,no one said a word as the old man continued.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517816.mp3,"""like everybody learns,"" he said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517817.mp3,"all this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517818.mp3,and he told what he had seen.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517819.mp3,he knew he was stronger than his friend.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517821.mp3,"and that he, a boy, could perform miracles."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517822.mp3,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517823.mp3,the englishman said nothing.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517824.mp3,"the alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake slithered away among the rocks."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517825.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517826.mp3,it was the pure language of the world.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_517828.mp3,"and, in that way, the months passed."
