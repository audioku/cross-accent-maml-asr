./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687012.mp3,the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687013.mp3,but i was also stumbling because i couldn't look away from these things.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687014.mp3,"he wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687015.mp3,"he arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687016.mp3,"ten years at the university, and here i am in a corral."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687045.mp3,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687046.mp3,running was futile because they were so small.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687047.mp3,"the dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687059.mp3,"""i'm looking for a treasure,"" said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687060.mp3,its lower end was still embedded.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687061.mp3,the boy thought it a strange question.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687062.mp3,no one said a word as the old man continued.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687063.mp3,they reminded him of the old man.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687064.mp3,"when he speaks in our language, i can interpret what he has said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687080.mp3,"at that time, it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687081.mp3,"as they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687082.mp3,the boy was surprised at his thoughts.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687083.mp3,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687084.mp3,the boy laughed -- out of happiness.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687085.mp3,what is the matter?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687086.mp3,in a couple of minutes.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687087.mp3,"""i used to live near el cairum,"" he said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687089.mp3,she told me to write a play for tonight.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687090.mp3,perhaps she forgot all about it.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687096.mp3,"""well, why don't we go there right now?"" the boy asked."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687097.mp3,"in those days, very few of the people had any idea about astronomy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687098.mp3,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687099.mp3,"he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost, too."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687100.mp3,"he had used the two stones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687101.mp3,"it was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687102.mp3,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687103.mp3,"""and i'd better read your books,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687104.mp3,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687105.mp3,"""you gave them everything i had!"" the boy said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687113.mp3,"""and i'm certain you'll find it,"" the alchemist said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687114.mp3,the display was underwhelming.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687115.mp3,"""why would a king be talking with a shepherd?"" the boy asked, awed and embarrassed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687116.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687118.mp3,suddenly the monster disappeared.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687119.mp3,"""it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil,"" said the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687120.mp3,"they called it the simum, and it was worse than a storm at sea."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687121.mp3,"there were just drawings, coded instructions, and obscure texts."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687122.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687123.mp3,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687124.mp3,"before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687125.mp3,"they forgot that lead, copper, and iron have their own destinies to fulfill."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687133.mp3,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687134.mp3,we've still got two bucks left!
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687135.mp3,"there were really, i think, two or three hundred people elbowing one another."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687136.mp3,"""you came so that you could learn about your dreams,"" said the old woman."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687137.mp3,"maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687138.mp3,"""why do they make things so complicated?"" he asked the englishman one night."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687139.mp3,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687140.mp3,"""this is the first phase of the job,"" he said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687151.mp3,"""your eyes show the strength of your soul,"" answered the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687152.mp3,the fumes from the traffic was unbearable.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687153.mp3,"""i came to tell you just one thing,"" the boy said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687154.mp3,"as he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687155.mp3,"""i'm going into the desert,"" the man answered, turning back to his reading."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687156.mp3,it was aligned perfectly.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687157.mp3,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687158.mp3,"they were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their turbans."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687159.mp3,"""but none of that is from the pyramids,"" said the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687160.mp3,"lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687170.mp3,"""always heed the omens,"" the old king had said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687171.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687172.mp3,i could feel that they were hungry for something.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_687173.mp3,"""he should have decided to become a shepherd,"" the boy said."
