./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68738.mp3,he didn't consider mending the hole -- the stones could fall through any time they wanted.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68739.mp3,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68740.mp3,you'll be the counselor of the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68741.mp3,but you don't know about love.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68743.mp3,"throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68744.mp3,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68745.mp3,"i know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know about crystal."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68746.mp3,"it was something that i thought could happen only to others, never to me."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68747.mp3,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68748.mp3,"from that day on, it was the desert that would be important."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68749.mp3,have trusted more in your love for fatima.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68756.mp3,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68757.mp3,"meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68760.mp3,"had our instruments permitted it, we might have been able to see the trouble way back when."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68761.mp3,"and also because i know about the soul of the world, he thought to himself."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68762.mp3,the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68763.mp3,"the thief wasn't there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68765.mp3,the boy spent a sleepless night.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68766.mp3,it was a tent like many at the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68767.mp3,the englishman asked if they were in danger.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68768.mp3,"it would have been visible to me, had i only looked up as it passed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68769.mp3,even the guides spoke very little to one another.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68770.mp3,"the strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68771.mp3,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68772.mp3,he quickly pulled his hands away.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68773.mp3,"it was seen early in the morning, rushing over eastward."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68781.mp3,"the two men exchanged some words in arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68782.mp3,the alchemist probably already knew all that.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68783.mp3,"""they are so used to me that they know my schedule,"" he muttered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68784.mp3,"""life attracts life,"" the alchemist answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68785.mp3,"they went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_68786.mp3,they continued across the desert.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78953.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78954.mp3,"it was starlight, and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78955.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78956.mp3,"at most, they thought that another meteorite had descended."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78957.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78958.mp3,"if you start your emails with ""greetings"" let me be the first to welcome you to earth."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78959.mp3,"i was scared, but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78960.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78961.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78962.mp3,"looking through the telescope, i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78963.mp3,"one can imagine these two, covered with sand, running up the little street in the bright sunlight."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78964.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78965.mp3,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78966.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78967.mp3,"the heather was on fire, and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78968.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78969.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78970.mp3,"for at that time, it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78971.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78972.mp3,its lower end was still embedded.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78973.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78974.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78975.mp3,"many people in berkshire, surrey, and middlesex must have seen it."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78976.mp3,"at that time, it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78977.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78978.mp3,"down below in the darkness were hundreds of people, sleeping in peace."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78979.mp3,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78980.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78981.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78982.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78983.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78984.mp3,"as soon as he saw me among the crowd, he called to me to come down."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78985.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78992.mp3,"as i watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78993.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78994.mp3,"air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78995.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78996.mp3,"we don't know what's in the confounded thing, do you? "
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78997.mp3,"from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains, ringing and rumbling."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78998.mp3,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_78999.mp3,and one or two persons were returning.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79000.mp3,"the level ground was blackened as far as one could see, and it was still giving off smoke."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79001.mp3,even then he hardly understood what this meant.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79002.mp3,"you don't have to be rich, skinny, popular, or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79006.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79007.mp3,"at once, he connected the two incidents."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79008.mp3,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79009.mp3,he got up early with the idea of finding it.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79010.mp3,i was impatient to see it opened.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79011.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79012.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_79013.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595576.mp3,except for the dream.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595577.mp3,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595578.mp3,"if you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595579.mp3,but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595580.mp3,"and he asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595581.mp3,"at that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595582.mp3,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595583.mp3,"he wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595584.mp3,"""they're not worth much,"" the englishman answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595585.mp3,"the alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595590.mp3,"the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595591.mp3,they reminded him of the old man.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595592.mp3,"he is going to transform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595593.mp3,"eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595594.mp3,"one night, the father had a dream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595595.mp3,the boy was surprised at his thoughts.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595596.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595597.mp3,"in those days, very few of the people had any idea about astronomy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595598.mp3,"he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost, too."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595603.mp3,"but he had found a guide, and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595604.mp3,his name was joseph.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595606.mp3,"""i don't much like change,"" he said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595616.mp3,"""and this is for me,"" said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595617.mp3,"if he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't truelove..."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595619.mp3,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595620.mp3,"then, you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595621.mp3,"their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_595622.mp3,"something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606104.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606107.mp3,it's not often that money can save someone's life.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606108.mp3,"the englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606109.mp3,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606110.mp3,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606111.mp3,"yes, that's what love is."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606122.mp3,they wanted to save the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_606123.mp3,he had understood the story the old king had told him.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31186.mp3,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31187.mp3,"it was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31190.mp3,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31191.mp3,"he did find it, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31192.mp3,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31193.mp3,"in those times, the master work could be written simply on an emerald."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31195.mp3,"he called to the boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31196.mp3,the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31198.mp3,"""because i've always heard about them,"" the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31199.mp3,"the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier, and business had fallen off."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31200.mp3,but he didn't need to worry about that right now.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31201.mp3,so the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31202.mp3,"there is a universal language, understood by everybody, but already forgotten."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31203.mp3,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31204.mp3,the wind approached the boy and touched his face.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31205.mp3,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31206.mp3,"then he dropped his spade, picked up his jacket, and came out into the road."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31207.mp3,i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31208.mp3,"then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31210.mp3,"for every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31211.mp3,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31212.mp3,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31213.mp3,"maybe that's why they give up on it so early, too."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31214.mp3,"but, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31215.mp3,"remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31216.mp3,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31218.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31219.mp3,he understands the forces of nature.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31220.mp3,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31221.mp3,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31222.mp3,"finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31223.mp3,"meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31224.mp3,"three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31225.mp3,"taking the jacket out, he began to clean the glasses."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31226.mp3,"it's true that everything has its destiny, but one day that destiny will be realized."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31229.mp3,it drew a droplet of blood.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31230.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31231.mp3,he appeared with the first stars of evening.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31232.mp3,and finally the falcon returned with their meal.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31233.mp3,"he thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31234.mp3,the idea frightened him.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31235.mp3,he was selling better than ever.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31236.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31237.mp3,"""drink and enjoy yourself,"" said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was feeling happier."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31238.mp3,don't try to enter into the life of the oasis.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31241.mp3,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31242.mp3,"it was a strange furnace, fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31243.mp3,"he wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31244.mp3,"and there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31245.mp3,i only interpret dreams.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31246.mp3,"whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31247.mp3,"from where he sat, he could observe the plaza."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31248.mp3,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31249.mp3,"after all, he had all his money."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31251.mp3,but he still couldn't flee.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31252.mp3,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31253.mp3,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31254.mp3,"""there are many languages spoken by things,"" the boy said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31255.mp3,"and seizing the boy's bag, the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31256.mp3,he condemned the commander to death without honor.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31257.mp3,there was a thud like the fall of a great mass.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_31258.mp3,"the old man gave a signal, and everyone stood."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550924.mp3,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550926.mp3,"""i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,"" said the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550927.mp3,"when you are loved, you can do anything in creation."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550928.mp3,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550929.mp3,there was surely a baker in her town.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550931.mp3,"""that's the magic of omens,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550932.mp3,"whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with his experience of the moment."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550933.mp3,"""this desert was once a sea,"" he said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550937.mp3,"he fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550938.mp3,"""i'm coming, fatima,"" he said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550939.mp3,and don't forget the language of omens.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550940.mp3,he couldn't have been wrong.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550941.mp3,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550942.mp3,"there were really, i think, two or three hundred people elbowing one another."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550943.mp3,"bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550944.mp3,"as he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd's pouch."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550946.mp3,"the levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550948.mp3,"""you can't be the wind,"" the wind said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550949.mp3,"""where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,"" the alchemist had told him."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550950.mp3,the sword didn't fall.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550952.mp3,the shepherd swore that he would.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550953.mp3,"""i don't much like change,"" he said."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550955.mp3,"the woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550957.mp3,it was the old man who spoke first.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550959.mp3,"""but none of that is from the pyramids,"" said the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550960.mp3,"i had the ""everyone has gary busey's teeth"" dream again."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550961.mp3,maybe it was because they moved around so much.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550962.mp3,"""did you say a king?"" he asked."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550963.mp3,"i was just in town earlier this year, so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550964.mp3,he said that everything has its own destiny.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550965.mp3,"""i'm the leader of the caravan,"" said a dark-eyed, bearded man."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550966.mp3,"everyone, when they are young, knows what their destiny is."

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550968.mp3,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550969.mp3,"the alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550970.mp3,"the alchemist dismounted, and told the escorts they could return to the camp."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550971.mp3,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550972.mp3,"""no,"" he heard a voice on the wind say."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550973.mp3,but the englishman was exultant.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550974.mp3,but the boy sat down and waited.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550975.mp3,"""am i going to find my treasure?"" he asked."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550976.mp3,"sometimes i appear in the form of a solution, or a good idea."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550977.mp3,"""there is only one way to learn,"" the alchemist answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550978.mp3,i used to look at those women and envy them their happiness.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550979.mp3,"i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550980.mp3,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550981.mp3,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550982.mp3,"all things are one, the boy thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550983.mp3,"the shop folks were taking down their shutters, and people were opening their bedroom windows."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550985.mp3,the little group of people from the city dispersed.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550986.mp3,"it would have been visible to me, had i only looked up as it passed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550987.mp3,"something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550988.mp3,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550989.mp3,and he immediately felt peace in his heart.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550990.mp3,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550991.mp3,"worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550992.mp3,"it was seen early in the morning, rushing over eastward."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550993.mp3,then the two went off to have some more tea.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550994.mp3,"if he ever decided to leave them, they would suffer."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550995.mp3,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550996.mp3,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550997.mp3,"""i want to stay at the oasis,"" the boy answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550998.mp3,"""but there's a tribal war,"" the boy reiterated."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_550999.mp3,"but, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551000.mp3,the boy began to dig into the dune.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551001.mp3,"a long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551002.mp3,"""this is what was written on the emerald tablet,"" said the alchemist, when he had finished."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551003.mp3,"and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me, but that i was learning from them."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551004.mp3,"""who are you?"" he heard a voice ask him in spanish."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551005.mp3,the boy was startled.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551009.mp3,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551010.mp3,"they began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551011.mp3,the boy awoke as the sun rose.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551012.mp3,i was impatient to see it opened.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551013.mp3,the sword remained where it was.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551014.mp3,the old man returned the book to the boy.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551015.mp3,"""the wind told me that you know about love"" the boy said to the sun."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_551016.mp3,"they have gotten used to my being away, and so have i."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149399.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149416.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149418.mp3,"and at that i told him, and he took my place."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149419.mp3,"i was scared, but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149420.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit.

./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_149448.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet.
