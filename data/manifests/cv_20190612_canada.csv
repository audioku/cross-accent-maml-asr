./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642530.mp3,you're supposed to be the one that has all the answers.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642531.mp3,aiding an escaped criminal.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642532.mp3,and if it is?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642533.mp3,her jeans have holes in them.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642534.mp3,will you come here?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642535.mp3,what's she saying now?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642536.mp3,how do you know what they're doing?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_642537.mp3,i should have been there.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26952.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26953.mp3,"""maybe tomorrow,"" said the boy, moving away."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26954.mp3,he told them all to be seated.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26955.mp3,"it's easy, and yet i've never done it before, he thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26956.mp3,and it knew nothing about love.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26957.mp3,"i'm afraid that if my dream is realized, i'll have no reason to go on living."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26958.mp3,several figures approached him.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26959.mp3,but he had to move on.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26960.mp3,"the boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to concentrate."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26961.mp3,"how strange africa is, thought the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26962.mp3,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26963.mp3,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26964.mp3,"""it's the oasis,"" said the camel driver."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26965.mp3,the boy preferred wine.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26966.mp3,the woman was silent for some time.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26967.mp3,"and yet, none of these people has ever met the old king."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26968.mp3,they mounted their horses.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26969.mp3,"""i'm an adventurer, looking for treasure,"" he said to himself."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26970.mp3,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26971.mp3,but he didn't stop.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26972.mp3,"sometimes it's better to be with the sheep, who don't say anything."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26973.mp3,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26974.mp3,"until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26975.mp3,"sadly, my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26976.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26978.mp3,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26979.mp3,so it's better to listen to what it has to say.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26980.mp3,he still had some doubts about the decision he had made.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26981.mp3,"the boy was surprised, and then irritated."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26982.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26983.mp3,"on the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26984.mp3,alchemy is a serious discipline.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26985.mp3,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26986.mp3,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26987.mp3,"""why a revolver?"" he asked."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26988.mp3,"""he lives at the al-fayoum oasis,"" his friend had said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26989.mp3,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26990.mp3,the tea seemed less bitter.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26991.mp3,"but, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26992.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26993.mp3,"we are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize that it is working for us."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26994.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26995.mp3,"his hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26996.mp3,"this man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles were reversed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26997.mp3,he started to read the book he had bought.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26998.mp3,"that night, he told all of this to the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_26999.mp3,it's a man who understands nature and the world.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27000.mp3,one is loved because one is loved.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27001.mp3,"""it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone,"" said the englishman."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27002.mp3,and he told what he had seen.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27003.mp3,"your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27004.mp3,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27005.mp3,"without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27006.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27007.mp3,i told you that your dream was a difficult one.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27008.mp3,the alchemist turned to the boy.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27009.mp3,"looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27010.mp3,"i don't want to change anything, because i don't know how to deal with change."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27011.mp3,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27012.mp3,"the day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27013.mp3,"""i'm leaving today,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27014.mp3,"it's true that everything has its destiny, but one day that destiny will be realized."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27015.mp3,"like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27016.mp3,"one night, the father had a dream."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27018.mp3,he won't leave the circle.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27019.mp3,"when you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27020.mp3,"the old man knew how to read, and had already read the book."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27021.mp3,it's not i the wind spoke about.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27022.mp3,"i'm an old, superstitious arab, and i believe in our proverbs."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27023.mp3,"the alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27024.mp3,"""and i'd better read your books,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27025.mp3,but use them to buy your flock.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27026.mp3,"when i had my sheep, i was happy, and i made those around me happy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27027.mp3,"it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27028.mp3,camels are traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27029.mp3,"""why would a king be talking with a shepherd?"" the boy asked, awed and embarrassed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27030.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27031.mp3,"""drink and enjoy yourself,"" said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was feeling happier."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27032.mp3,"there were just drawings, coded instructions, and obscure texts."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27033.mp3,"we know that, and we are used to it."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27034.mp3,i told him that was what i had come here to learn.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27035.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27036.mp3,only when he consents.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27037.mp3,"if what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27038.mp3,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27039.mp3,"i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night, and they hurt!"
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27040.mp3,"the day was hot, and the wine was refreshing."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27041.mp3,"he had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27042.mp3,"as he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd's pouch."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27043.mp3,"""why do they make things so complicated?"" he asked the englishman one night."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27044.mp3,"""well, usually i learn more from my sheep than from books,"" he answered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27045.mp3,"the levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27046.mp3,his name was joseph.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27047.mp3,"the sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27048.mp3,this is for you.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27049.mp3,"""your eyes show the strength of your soul,"" answered the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27050.mp3,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27051.mp3,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27052.mp3,"they were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their turbans."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27053.mp3,"i wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27054.mp3,"as he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27055.mp3,"then she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27056.mp3,the people were also praying to heaven for protection.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27057.mp3,"with the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27058.mp3,"the alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27059.mp3,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27060.mp3,"""once you get into the desert, there's no going back,"" said the camel driver."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27061.mp3,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27062.mp3,"he paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27063.mp3,"if he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't truelove..."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27064.mp3,then she filled her vessel with water and left.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27065.mp3,even me -- i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27066.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27067.mp3,"""i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,"" the boy repeated."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27068.mp3,"then, you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27069.mp3,"night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27070.mp3,"their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27071.mp3,the boy watched the exchange with fascination.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27072.mp3,"""i don't understand what you're talking about,"" the desert said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27073.mp3,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27074.mp3,he told me i should try to do so.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27075.mp3,there was hardly any movement from the pit.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27076.mp3,"next morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al- fayoum."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27077.mp3,"""i want to tell you a story about dreams,"" said the alchemist."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27078.mp3,most of them were staring quietly at the big table.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27079.mp3,"looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27080.mp3,the wind has many names.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27081.mp3,"in any case, the desert was impassable."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27082.mp3,"""we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise,"" was the alchemist's only response."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27083.mp3,let me tell you what will happen.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27084.mp3,"the vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27085.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27086.mp3,"and, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that soul."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27088.mp3,"""it is i who dared to do so,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27089.mp3,the old man looked disappointed.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27090.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27091.mp3,"they must be used to their new shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27092.mp3,"""let's stop this,"" another commander said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27093.mp3,"the englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27094.mp3,"i've already had that experience with my sheep, and now it's happening with people."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27095.mp3,"a friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27096.mp3,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27097.mp3,"""they are so used to me that they know my schedule,"" he muttered."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27098.mp3,"""but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live,"" the boy explained."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27099.mp3,"i don't mind working from home most of the time, but i do miss having coworkers."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27100.mp3,the boy awoke as the sun rose.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27101.mp3,"looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27102.mp3,"""gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,"" sighed the old man."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27103.mp3,"at that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27104.mp3,"they have gotten used to my being away, and so have i."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27105.mp3,they were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his destiny to the end.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27106.mp3,"the camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27107.mp3,"today, i understand something i didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27108.mp3,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27109.mp3,he decided to spend the night there.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_27110.mp3,"""these are the spies,"" said one of the men."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107249.mp3,i guess i was homesick.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107250.mp3,how can you tell?
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107251.mp3,"i'm going to find that damned alchemist, the englishman thought."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107252.mp3,"it swayed in the air, like weeping willows."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107253.mp3,"you and i aren't like hassan, that rich merchant."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107254.mp3,"as the englishman left, fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107255.mp3,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this!
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107256.mp3,they mounted their horses.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107257.mp3,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107258.mp3,"""the war is going to end someday,"" the girl said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107259.mp3,"having heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107260.mp3,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107261.mp3,"""lots of places sell tea around here,"" the merchant said."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107262.mp3,"sometimes it's better to be with the sheep, who don't say anything."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107263.mp3,to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107264.mp3,"for dinner, they had cesar salad."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107265.mp3,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107266.mp3,no one paid any attention to the two travelers.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107267.mp3,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107268.mp3,"he was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was right."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107269.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107270.mp3,i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107272.mp3,"the sea has lived on in this shell, because that's its destiny."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107273.mp3,"""i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,"" the alchemist smiled."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107274.mp3,"""good-bye,"" said the boy."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107275.mp3,"and it's not love to see everything from a distance, like you do."
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107276.mp3,the place is so full of cockroaches.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107277.mp3,i'm the one that knows.
./data/CommonVoice2_dataset/clips/common_voice_en_107278.mp3,you'll be the counselor of the oasis.
